## 🎯 The 7 Strategic Questions

Before diving into table selection, we defined **7 core questions** that drive all analytics requirements:

### Q1: Who are our most valuable customers?
- **Metrics**: Total revenue, order count, average order value, gross margin, CLV proxy, Pareto concentration
- **Data Grain**: Customer × Order
- **Time Windows**: Full history, Last 12 months, Last 24 months
- **Key Entities**: Customer, SalesOrderHeader, SalesOrderDetail

### Q2: Which customers are unprofitable or risky?
- **Metrics**: Revenue per customer, cost proxies (returns, discounts), recency, frequency
- **Data Grain**: Customer × Time (monthly)
- **Time Windows**: Rolling windows (3, 6, 12 months)
- **Key Entities**: Customer, Orders, Returns (if available)

### Q3: How do customers differ in behavior (heterogeneity)?
- **Metrics**: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), basket size, category diversity
- **Data Grain**: Customer level
- **Time Windows**: Calibration window, Observation window
- **Key Entities**: Customer, Orders, Products

### Q4: Are newer customer cohorts better or worse?
- **Metrics**: Cohort size, retention rate, revenue per cohort, orders per cohort
- **Data Grain**: Cohort × Period
- **Time Windows**: Cohort month, Months since acquisition
- **Key Entities**: Customer, First purchase date, Orders

### Q5: Who is likely still active vs "dead"?
- **Metrics**: Last purchase date, purchase count, inter-purchase time, BTYD inputs
- **Data Grain**: Customer level
- **Time Windows**: Calibration vs holdout
- **Key Entities**: Customer, Orders

### Q6: What actions should we take (prescriptive)?
- **Metrics**: Predicted CLV, discount cost, incremental lift assumptions
- **Data Grain**: Customer × Action scenario
- **Time Windows**: Forward-looking (12–36 months)
- **Key Entities**: Customer, Orders, Promotions

### Q7: What is the value of our overall customer base? (CBCV)
- **Metrics**: Aggregated CLV projections, retention metrics, cohort performance
- **Data Grain**: Customer-level aggregated to portfolio
- **Time Windows**: Future projections (1–5 years)
- **Key Entities**: Customers, Transactions, Cohorts, Spend metrics

*(Full result set includes 72 tables - truncated for brevity)*

**Interpretation**:
- **Hub (Dimension)**: Tables with many **incoming** FKs → referenced by other tables (e.g., Customer, Person)
- **Spoke (Fact)**: Tables with many **outgoing** FKs → reference dimension tables (e.g., SalesOrderHeader, SalesOrderDetail)
- **Bridge/Lookup**: Connector tables or small reference tables

---

### **PHASE 2: Relationship Discovery (10 minutes)**
**Objective**: Understand how tables connect and identify dimension vs fact tables.

#### Step 4: Run Query #4 - Hub and Spoke Analysis
**Purpose**: Classify tables by their role in the data model.

*(Full result set includes 94 foreign key relationships - truncated for brevity)*

**Key Insight**: This tells you:
- `SalesOrderHeader` references `Customer` → Many orders per customer
- `Customer` references `Person` → One-to-one or optional relationship
- `SalesOrderDetail` references `Product` → Many line items per product

---

#### Step 6: Run Query #6 - Date/Time Columns Finder
**Purpose**: Identify temporal columns for RFM, cohorts, and retention analysis.

```
-- Query #6: Date/Time Columns Finder (lines 180-205 in metadata-exploration-v2.sql)

| Sales | CurrencyRate | CurrencyRateDate | datetime | 13,532 | Other Date |

*(Full result set includes 128 date/time columns - truncated for brevity)*

**Critical Finding**: `SalesOrderHeader.OrderDate` is the **primary temporal anchor** for:
- **Recency** (time since last order)
- **Cohorts** (first order month)
- **Trends** (order patterns over time)

---

### **PHASE 3: Table Shortlisting (5 minutes)**
**Objective**: Narrow down to 10-15 most relevant tables based on discovery results.

#### Step 7: Review Query #3 and Query #7 Results Side by Side
Create a **shortlist scorecard** using these criteria:

| Criterion | Weight | How to Evaluate |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Analytics Category Match** | High | Must be Customer, Transaction, or Product category |
| **Table Role** | High | Prefer Hubs (dimensions) and Spokes (facts) |
| **Row Count** | Medium | Larger tables = more analytical value |
| **Date Column Presence** | High | Required for temporal analysis (RFM, cohorts) |
| **Relationship Density** | Medium | Tables with 2+ relationships are well-connected |

#### Step 8: Apply Scorecard to Candidate Tables

**Example Evaluation**:

| Table | Category | Role | Rows | Date Cols | Relationships | Include? |
|-------|----------|------|------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Sales.Customer | Customer | Hub | 19,820 | 1 | 3 | ✅ YES |
| Sales.SalesOrderHeader | Transaction | Spoke | 31,465 | 4 | 8 | ✅ YES |
| Sales.SalesOrderDetail | Transaction | Spoke | 121,317 | 1 | 3 | ✅ YES |
| Person.Person | Person | Hub | 19,972 | 1 | 3 | ✅ YES |
| Production.Product | Product | Bridge | 504 | 4 | 4 | ✅ YES |
| Person.Address | Location | Hub | 19,614 | 1 | 2 | ✅ YES |
| Sales.SpecialOffer | Other | Standalone | 16 | 2 | 1 | ⚠️ MAYBE |
| HumanResources.Employee | Other | Hub | 290 | 2 | 4 | ❌ NO (out of scope) |

**Final Shortlist** (17 tables selected):

**Dimensions / Hub Tables** (9):
1. Sales.Customer
2. Person.Person
3. Person.EmailAddress
4. Person.Address
5. Person.StateProvince
6. Sales.SalesTerritory
7. Production.Product
8. Production.ProductSubcategory
9. Production.ProductCategory

**Facts / Transaction Tables** (2):
10. Sales.SalesOrderHeader
11. Sales.SalesOrderDetail

**Bridge / Lookup Tables** (6):
12. Person.BusinessEntityAddress
13. Person.AddressType
14. Sales.SpecialOffer
15. Sales.SpecialOfferProduct
16. Sales.SalesOrderHeaderSalesReason
17. Sales.SalesReason

---

### **PHASE 4: Detailed Analysis (As Needed)**
**Objective**: Deep dive into shortlisted tables to define the ERD schema.

#### Step 9: Run Phase 4 Queries with Filters
For each shortlisted table, run:

**Query #8 - Primary Keys** (lines 323-345):
```sql
-- Find primary keys for ERD unique identifiers
WHERE SCHEMA_NAME(t.schema_id) = 'Sales' AND t.name = 'Customer';
```

**Query #9 - Foreign Key Relationships** (lines 354-381):
```sql
-- Get FK details for ERD relationship lines
WHERE SCHEMA_NAME(p.schema_id) = 'Sales' OR p.name LIKE '%Customer%';
```

**Query #10 - Column Details** (lines 390-408):
```sql
-- List all columns for ERD table definitions
WHERE SCHEMA_NAME(t.schema_id) = 'Sales' AND t.name = 'SalesOrderHeader';
```

#### Step 10: Document Findings in ERD Format
Use the DBML format to define each table:

```dbml
Table Sales_Customer {
  CustomerID int [pk, not null]
  PersonID int
  TerritoryID int
  AccountNumber varchar(10) [not null]
  ModifiedDate datetime [not null]

  Note: 'Customer master. One row per customer. Links to Person and SalesTerritory; drives customer-level RFM/CLV.'
}
```
